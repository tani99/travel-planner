# Travel Planner

A basic React Native app with email/password and Google authentication. Users can sign up or log in and then see a simple welcome screen. Built with Expo so it runs on both Android and iOS.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Configure Firebase in `firebase.js` with your project's settings.

3. Supply Google OAuth client IDs in the auth screens (`LoginScreen.js` and `SignupScreen.js`).

## Running

```bash
npm start
```

Use the Expo client on a device or emulator to run on Android or iOS.
